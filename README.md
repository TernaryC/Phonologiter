# Phonologiter
 A tool to create phonologies for conlangs (constructed languages).

## What is this?
 Phonologiter is a tool for conlangers, or people who construct languages (either as a hobby or as part of their profession), to make creating phonologies easier. It allows you to create easy-to-read phonology charts, as well as listen to different phonemes from within the program.

## Using Phonologiter
 Each mode of Phonologiter has up to three different pages, viewable using the Consonants, Vowels, and Other Symbols buttons at the bottom of the window. Some of these buttons may be disabled in Simple Chart mode (see below).
 
### Modes of Use
 
#### Full IPA Chart
 In this mode, you will see the full range of IPA symbols, sorted into columns and rows across the three pages.
 
 These symbols are, for the most part, organized identically to how they are on the official IPA chart. Some symbols, however, are listed in approximated positions, such as /w/ and /ɕ/.
 Other symbols still, like /ɺ/, are listed near to their correct positions, but not exactly where they belong. These symbols are marked with (parenthesis).
 The positions of symbols on the Vowels page are also approximated, as vowels are typically sorted on a "vowel trapezoid" instead of a rows-and-columns chart.
 
 You can select and deselect IPA symbols by clicking on them. Selected symbols will be highlighted blue.
 
#### Simple Chart
 In this mode, you will see a simplified and condensed version of the IPA chart, containing only the symbols you have selected in Full IPA Chart mode. Pages that you have not selected any symbols in will not be viewable.
 
#### Sound Test
 In this mode, you will see the full range of IPA symbols, much like in Full IPA Chart mode. Instead of selecting and deselecting symbols, though, in this mode clicking on symbols will play a sound to indicate how each symbol is meant to be pronounced. These sounds sourced from Wikipedia [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/General_phonetics], and are provided by Peter Isotalo, user:Adamsa123, user:Denelson83, and UCLA Phonetics Lab Archive 2003, and used under various copyleft licenses. The specific licenses for each sound can be found by clicking on the sound in the link above.
 
### Files

#### Opening and Saving Phonologies
 You are able to open and save phonologies using the File menu.
  
#### Exporting Phonologies
 The Export File option in the File menu allows you to save your phonology as a .ods file, openable in most commonly used spreadsheet programs, such as OpenOffice and Microsoft Excel.
